# :railway_track: Roadmap :railway_track:

This document is intended for unstructured or partially structured notes about the future of this project. Ideally, plans made in this document should at some point be formulated as goals so that they can become building blocks of new milestones in [MILESTONES.md](./MILESTONES.md).

### Immediate Next Steps




---

### Further Down the Road

inductive miner  
heuristic miner  
visualization of results (probably using dot format from graphviz)  
conformance checking   
simulation   
play in / play out / replay   
.csv and database API   
CI/CD covers a sufficient range of systems   
IO supports legacy file types (particularly .mxml)   




---

### General Guidelines for PRs

code should be clean and documented
naming conventions are [standard Julia naming conventions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/)
some conventions for functions: 

    + should be short and concise
    + should do what the name implies (and nothing more)
    
correctness first, then optimization
minimize dependencies

### Potential Milestones for Next Year

registration as an official Julia package   
submission to [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index)   
presentation at [JuliaCon 2022](https://juliacon.org/2021/) (date and location are not yet published, this link leads to JuliaCon 2021)
